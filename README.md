# Credit Risk Modelling

This project is a solution for chaper 01 of the book [Machine Learning Solutions - Jalaj Thanaki](https://www.amazon.com.br/Machine-Learning-Solutions-Jalaj-Thanaki/dp/1788390040), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github).

We are building ML model which can help us in order get an idea, whether a person will be doing any default activity for his loan in next 2 year.

In this project we want to make an algorithm that can predict to whom fonacial institutes should give loans or credit. When a financial institute it's necessary verify whether or not the borrower will have enough money in the future. This manual analysis can be automatized. 

So, our algorithm will output a probability value that indicates tha change of a borrowers defaulting. Here, high probabilities indicate that they would be a bad borrower. Otherwise, a low value indicates that they will be good for the financial intitution and will not default in the next 2 yeras. (Machine Learning Solution)
